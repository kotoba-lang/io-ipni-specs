  "The ClojureScript half of this library's qualification.

   It exists because it was missing. `ipni.sign` was landed with 93 JVM
   assertions and shipped a defect that only appears on ClojureScript --
   `(int c)` reads a code point on the JVM and returns 0 there, so every
   character of the signed payload-type became a NUL byte. The advertisement
   still built, still had a CID, and still signed. An indexer would have
   answered 400 and said nothing about why.

   A `.cljc` test belongs in BOTH lists below. Being required is not being
   run.
