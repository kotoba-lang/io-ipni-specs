(ns ipni.octets
  "String → bytes, on both runtimes.

  One namespace rather than a private copy in each, because the copies
  drifted into the same defect three times: `(int c)` reads a code point
  on the JVM and returns **0** on ClojureScript, where `(seq \"ab\")`
  yields one-character STRINGS and there is no character type.

  Nothing caught it, because this library had no ClojureScript test
  runner while claiming to be portable `.cljc`. What it produced there
  was an advertisement whose payload-type field was a run of NUL bytes
  and whose signature therefore covered the wrong record -- and the only
  symptom at an indexer is a bare HTTP 400.

  UTF-8, because a multiaddr, a peer ID and a payload type are all
  compared as bytes by the far side.")
