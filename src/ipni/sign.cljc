(ns ipni.sign
  "The bytes an IPNI advertisement signature is actually over.

  The spec says only that the advertisement is \"serialized, with all
  instances of `Signature` replaced with an empty array of bytes\", then
  \"hashed, and the hash is then signed\". It names neither the hash, nor
  the serialization, nor whether the result is raw. Every one of those
  gaps comes back as a bare HTTP 400 from an indexer, which is the same
  shape this library already measured for the announce message.

  So this namespace states what go-libipni does, and the test pins it to
  a real advertisement fetched from a live third-party publisher: the
  payload this code derives equals the one inside their envelope, and
  their signature verifies over the record this code frames. That is an
  external oracle -- checking our construction against our own is how a
  wrong construction stays green.

  Three layers, kept apart because only the middle one is IPNI's:

    signature-payload   the concatenation go-libipni hashes
    signed-record       libp2p's domain-separated framing of any payload
    envelope            libp2p's Envelope protobuf, which holds the result

  No crypto here, same rule as the rest of the library: `hash-fn`,
  `sign-fn` and `verify-fn` are injected. A missing one is an error, not
  an unsigned pass."
